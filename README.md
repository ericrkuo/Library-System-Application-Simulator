# Library-System-Application-Simulator

This application is a windows OS program that allows users to simulate a library application. 

## Motivation
I've always loved reading books and watching movies, thus I wanted to simulate a user experience for borrowing media items as best as I could. This was also my first project in Java and OOP. 

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- JavaFX Software Platform

## Features
All media items can be filtered by their availability, their types (books or movies), and their categories (action, adventure, etc.). Users can also search up media items by their title or identification numbers. The application also saves your previous session information including the number of items you borrowed, and which items were borrowed. 

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.
